# Agent System Protocol

This project uses a multi-agent architecture. Every agent MUST follow this protocol.

## On Session Start
1. Read `.agents/state.json` to understand current project state, active task, and context
2. Read `.agents/workspace-map.md` if you need to locate files or understand project structure
3. Identify your role and act within your boundaries
4. Do NOT proceed on a handoff if `handoff.approved_by_user` is `false` — wait for user approval

## On Session End
1. Update `.agents/state.json` with:
   - What you accomplished (add to `changelog`)
   - Current task status
   - Any blockers or decisions made
   - Updated `last_updated` and `last_updated_by`
2. Update `.agents/state.md` with a human-readable summary of changes
3. If you created or moved files, update `.agents/workspace-map.md`

## State Files — Do Not Proliferate
- `.agents/state.json` — Machine state (single source of truth)
- `.agents/state.md` — Human-readable dashboard
- `.agents/workspace-map.md` — File/directory reference
- `.agents/handoff.md` — Current handoff prompt
- `.agents/MODULES.md` — Module registry for complex projects (3+ modules)
- **No other state/summary files.** If it's not in these files, it doesn't exist.

## Code Standards
- Write clean, readable code with meaningful names
- Handle errors at system boundaries (user input, API calls, external data)
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
- Run tests before declaring work complete

## Communication Principles
- **Always include WHY**: Explain reasoning, not just actions
- **Research first**: Search the codebase before creating something new
- **Close the loop**: If tests fail, fix and re-run. Never report broken state
- **Keep workspace organized**: Update `.agents/workspace-map.md` when files change
